  <div class="description">
    <strong>TL;DR</strong> Specify your webapp&rsquo;s monitoring in a plain text file that your
    monitoring provider reads at http://yoursite.tld/monitors.txt to setup your monitors
  </div>

  <h2>What is monitors.txt?</h2>

  <p>
    A text file that lives at <a href="#">www.yoursite.tld/monitors.txt</a> and describes in plain text what monitoring
    you want done on your site.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your monitoring provider regularly reads your monitors.txt file to configure your application's monitors. Due to the
    open nature of monitors.txt,
    you'll be able to quickly switch monitor providers or even add new providers without hassle.
  </p>

  <h2>Define monitors where they belong</h2>

  <p>
    One intention of monitors.txt is to encourage developers to improve monitoring for their web sites by making it easy
    to setup new monitors;
    I don't enjoy logging into some monitoring service web app to setup monitors, but I do enjoy writing readable
    monitoring tests right there in my code,
    where they belong.
  </p>

  <h2>What if I want to keep my monitor configuration private?</h2>

  <p>
    Two ways spring to mind:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Restrict access to the file so only your monitoring provider can read it<br/><br/></li>
    <li>For the more gung-ho, obfuscate the URL and use SSL (e.g. <a href="#">https://yoursite.tld/something-unguessable/monitors.txt</a>)
      and tell your provider where to find your monitors.txt
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Show me a sample monitors.txt already</h2>

  <p>
    A basic monitors.txt file for monitorstxt.org
  </p>

	<pre>
# monitors.txt - see http://monitorstxt.org for more info
Scenario: The monitorstxt.com domain should redirect to monitorstxt.org
  When I visit http://monitorstxt.com
  Then I should be redirected to http://monitorstxt.org

Scenario: Home page shows a sample monitors.txt file
  When I visit http://monitorstxt.org
  Then I should see "Home page shows a sample monitors.txt file" within "body"

Scenario: DNS should resolve monitorstxt.org to the correct IP address
  When I use DNS to lookup monitorstxt.org
  Then I should see the IP address 207.97.227.245
	</pre>
  <p>
    And something with a few more bells and whistles :
  </p>
	<pre>
# monitors.txt - A sample monitor for DuckDuckGo

# Feature information is optional
Feature: DuckDuckGo Search
  It should continue to kick ass
  And I should be able to search

  Scenario: Homepage performance
    When I go to http://www.duckduckgo
    Then I should see the page downloaded in less than 0.5 seconds
    And I should see the page assets downloaded in less than 2 seconds

  Scenario: Search over SSL
    Given I go to https://www.duckduckgo
    When I fill in "q" with "site:news.ycombinator.com"
    And I press submit
    Then I should be on https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Anews.ycombinator.com
    And I should see "Hacker News" within "h2"

	</pre>

  <h2>monitors.txt looks a lot like a Cucumber feature</h2>

  <p>
    I want monitors.txt to be flexible and easy to read, hence why I've gone with this format. Alternative formats to
    Cucumber's Gherkin can be supported if needed.
  </p>

  <h2>Feedback appreciated</h2>
